### Why did you choose to implement this program?

### Describe the development process used in the completion of the project. 

### Provide the method header for a method that you implemented that takes at least one parameter. Explain why you chose the given parameter(s), including type, and why you made the method static or non-static. 

### Provide the code segment(s) where two distinct methods in the String class are called. Describe what each method call is doing, and what is being returned (if anything) by the method calls. 

### Copy and paste one code segment that uses nested conditional statements or compound Boolean expressions. What is one other way that this code could be written to achieve the same result? Provide an equivalent code segment to the one included above. 

### Copy and paste one code segment that uses iteration. Describe how the loop you used works and provide an equivalent code segment to the one included above that uses a different type of loop.
